When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I have someone working on the project with me remotely or if when I am working on the project but dont 
have access to my local machine at the moment.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

there might be some changes in the public repository that you might not want on your local machine,
pulling changes manually give the user the control over when to pull the changes from the remote public repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are used when you want to clone a repository straight to git hub and leave a indication to where it was originally taken from.
clones are used when you want to clone a repository to your local computer.
branches are used to make changes that you dont want to show up in your master branch just yet.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 You can work offline, it saves a lot of data overhead when pushing changes to github and it gives the possibility to do a quick check which changes are made in the online repo compared to the offline repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

collaborating remotely without using git or github would work using emails , uploading files on varions cloud services or using screen sharing. keeping a log of every change would be much harder and the productivity will be slow.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

when I am working on a project as part of a team and want to make changes to a file in the master without having to alter the master files. A seperate branch is created and the experemental changes are made, if deemed relative and is approved then the branch can be merged into the master.
This approach keeps the master branch working and unaffected by the new experemental code, until that code is approved.


commands:
git remote  |    Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote add origin url |     Add a new remote location for the repository. Origin is the default name to use when you create only one remote location. Url should be the https url to the github repository.
git remove -v  |    Outputs the remote locations with verbose information (fetch and push urls)
git push origin master  |    Push the master branch to the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    = Git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
git fetch origin  |    Get the changes from the remote location into the (hidden?) origin/master branch
